In the recent weeks I got captured by a thought: What if I had a computer in my kitchen? Fueled by my fascination for Apple Silicon the focus quickly landed on the new M4 Mac Mini.

The project also was a nice justification for the purchase of my 3D-printer! I could find perfect, ready-made parts on [printables.com](https://www.printables.com/) to mount the Mac Mini and the "IKEA Koppola" to the underside of my kitchen table. Additionally, some printed clamps and guides allowed for clean cable management.

As ridiculous as it sounds: Being on a computer in the kitchen was and is a different experience for me. 10/10 would recommend!
